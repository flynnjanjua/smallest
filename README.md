# smallest
Explanation:
This code implements a program to find the largest and smallest numbers in a given list of numbers.

The find_largest_smallest function takes a parameter numbers, which is the list of numbers, and performs the following steps:

It first checks if the numbers list is empty. If it is, it returns None for both the smallest and largest numbers to indicate that no numbers were entered.
It initializes the smallest and largest variables with the first element of the numbers list.
It iterates over each number in the numbers list.
For each number, it compares it with the current smallest and largest numbers.
If the number is smaller than the current smallest, it updates the smallest variable.
If the number is larger than the current largest, it updates the largest variable.
After iterating through all the numbers, it returns the final values of the smallest and largest variables.
In the main part of the code, the user is prompted to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. The input is stored in the input_list variable. The input string is then split into individual numbers using the split() method, and each number is converted to an integer using a list comprehension to form the numbers list.
The find_largest_smallest function is called with the numbers list as an argument to find the smallest and largest numbers. The resulting values are stored in the smallest_num and largest_num variables.
Finally, the program checks if smallest_num is None to determine if any numbers were entered. If no numbers were entered, it prints "No numbers were entered." Otherwise, it prints the smallest and largest numbers.

Please note that this code assumes that the user will provide valid input with numbers separated by spaces. Additional input validation and error handling may be necessary to handle invalid inputs or handle edge cases.
